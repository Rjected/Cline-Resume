# personal-info
Here you should make `phone-number.tex`, `email.tex`, and `github.tex`.
Then, populate these files with your phone number, email, and github.
These will not be put in the git history or hosted, because these files are in the `.gitignore`.
These files only really control three elements at the top right of the resume, so you don't actually have to populate them with your phone number, email, or github.
You could put whatever you want in there.

There are sample files in this directory which you can use and rename.
