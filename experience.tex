\descript{| SWE Intern or \textit{whatever}}
\location{An interesting place \\ Over the summer}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Worked on some very cool stuff with some very cool people, made a lot of stuff a lot better
\item Just explaining stuff in more detail, I used some technology to improve some aspect of some system or product and here are some very general results.
\item Here are some more specific results or improvements if you care, I'm just putting this here so my big internship has 3 lines and seems more important rather than less.

\runsubsection{Maybe a smaller company}
\descript{| Software Engineer Intern}
\location{Town or City, State \\ June 20XX - August 20XX}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Did some stuff at this company
\item Maybe you did, maybe you didn't do as interesting stuff as big company but you still have to explain it and try to impress the recruiter
\item We all know people like numbers, so let's see that 10X increase in something \textbf{important!}

\runsubsection{Idk something else?}
\descript{| Some title}
\location{Probably your hometown \\ You did this in high school}
\begin{tightemize}
\item You might have actually done some interesting stuff but you can't make it seem less important than the big company.
\item Alternatively, you didn't do anything interesting and have to make it seem like you did, similar to the ``Maybe a smaller company'' example.
