\item You develop software! You should have something you're passionate about here!
\item It's okay if you're new to programming or software, making things is hard but here is where you show what you're \textit{excited} about!

\begin{tightemize}
\item Contributing to open source is one of the best ways to learn how to write good code. You might encounter some bad code though, and that's where you can contribute!
\item This is another area to show something you're interested in - open source is awesome and some projects may give you similar SWE skills and experience to the big company up above.

\descript{| Open-source project - co-author}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Not everyone writes code in every waking moment of their life. Build something you're proud of!
\item However, everyone has projects they're embarrassed of, and sometimes that is the project that goes here.
\item This could even be a school project!
